<h1>Console coding (VS code)</h1>
<h3>(Note: whatever you will be coding in this Project will have to be written in script tag.also what you will be learning is called JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX. Basically what you are doing is coding javascript in HTML.)</h3>

<p>Hi and welcome to the " learn to code in VS code " show with Taksh Aurora! Hey! learn to code with VS code rhymes! anyways. All the basic things you need to know about it? I got you covered homie! Now Note: This tutorial only teaches you about the console function of VS code. Other tutorials will come later!</p>
<h2>Defination</h2>
<p>Ok first things first.. Console Defination. The google defination is the nerdy version. "  the “console” tab where you can output debug and execute commands in to the current web page" My version is..... Console is kinda' the place where errors pop up and give you the perfect explanation of what is wrong with the code you have written.</p>
<h2>How to use Console></h2>
<p>Ok.. Now that you know how to do that lets show you how to open and inspect it. (Note: This is for Windows only. I work on a windows .These instructions may or may not work on IOS or Linux etc.)</p>
<p>Go to a new google ( brower that you use) tab and right click anywhere on the tab.The click on INSPECT button in the pane that pops up. Now a whole quarter of the right of your screen will be covered with somethin'. A black panel.</p>
<p>Now on the top you would see options. Like: Elements, Console,Sources,Network.</p>
<p>Click on the console tab.. And here you are. When you go up there you may or may not see this message. ("DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://fheoggkfdfchfphceeifdbepaooicaho/sourceMap/chrome/iframe_handler.map: HTTP error: status code 404, net::ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME".)</p>
<p>Dont worry. your computer is working fine!</p>
<p>CONGRATS! you are a quarter way there!</p>
<p>Now lets get to the exciting bit!</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>Ok.. Now that we know what console is and how it looks. We should begin coding so that we can see text and other cool stuff in the console!</p>
<p>1) Know this. Put all the code in a SCRIPT TAG. Now,  To implent ANYTHING in the console there is a simple line of code you need to know. Type " console.log()" in VS code.</p>
<p>( Note: of couse before typing this you need to type all the essential elements of HTML. If you wanna know that... Google it.)</p>
<p>2) Simplest trick. Inside the console.log's parantheses's =>( ) put 2 quotes => "". Now here type anything. For basics just type " hi " or "Hello World".After that type a semicolon => ;</p>
<p>(Note: Whatever you type has to be put INSIDE the quotes.. )</p>
<p>In the end the result should be "  console.log("Hi");</p>
<p>Now run your VS code program, Do the same steps.Open the console and if what you did is right, then you should see Hi witten there. Good job!</p>
<p>Actually! Open the console of this article. The first line of text would be a " HELLO WORLD"! That is my code and it is a example of what you need to see if you do it right!</p>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>Ok! More code coming your way! lets have some variable action! Now we are entering the techinical side of things. And i really you need to focus in this bit. So whatever I type in caps lock is of extreme importance after this line of text.</p>
<p>What is a variable? A VARIABLE IS THE ELEMENT OF CODING THAT STORES DATA AND VALUES. you represent this element by typing var and naming your variable.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE : var my_name.....</p>
<p>Now put a equal sign => (=). and in quotes => "", type your value or the data you need to store (In my example) => Taksh Aurora </p>
<p>In the end you should get this result => var my_name="Taksh Aurora"</p>
<h2>Use of variable</h2>
<p>Instead of using the same terms again and again. you can use the assigned name of the variable instead of the value itself.Variables are like Pronouns. So - var x=10 is a variable. Now instead of writing 10 again and again you can just type x in your code. COOL right?</p>
<h2>Implementing variables with the console function</h2>
<p>I dont think i need to explain this one bit! If you understood what i said before the straight up conclusion to this would be..</p>
<p>var number_1="3.14159265358979"..............
   
   
    console.log(number_1)
</p>
<p>EASY! now instead of writing "3.14159265358979" you can write number_1 or any name you assign to that particular variable. If you understood this then you are QUICKLY on your way of understanding console coding!</p>
<p>open the console of this website and you will see the lage number but i would have used a small name for it!</p>

<h2>.concat</h2>
<p>.concat is a component of coding that joins 2 variable values.</p>
<p>For example: var A="Taksh" and var B="Aurora"</p>
<p>What you can now do is A.concat(B); and result => TakshAurora.</p>
<p>Note: Type this is in the script tag like all the other console related code AND put this concat function inside the brackets of the console.log component.)</p>
<p>result => console.log(A.concat( B)</p>
<p>Open the console of this article and you will see the result of the concat function.</p>
<h2>MATH functions</h2>
<p>Lets play with numbers! Now there are many math functions. I will tell you the cool ones.</p>
<h2>ADDITION and SUBTRACTION</h2>
<p>This is very easy. So, i will just show you the solution. It must be self explanatory if you understood what i have said in the earlier terms.</p>
<p>var num_1=1.....var num_2=1.....console.log(num_1 + num_2). Easy right?</p>
<p>Now if you did it right the answer in the console should be 2 (duh!).</p>
<p>open the console of this console and you will see the answer.</p>
<p>NOTE IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUT THE VALUE OF YOUR VARIABLE IN DOUBLE QUOTES.. IF YOU DO THIS THEN THE COMPUTER THE VALUE AS A STRING.AND YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE 11.</p>
<h2>typeof</h2>
<p>Remember when I mentioned string? well there are two types of values. STRING AND NUMBER. if you add quotes => "" then it regesters the value as string. If not then it will be registered as a number.</p>
<p>so there is a way to code is so that the computer would tell us if the value of the variable is a string or number.</p>
<p>var A_1="HI"...console.log(typeof A_1)</p>
<p>var A_2=1....console.log(typeof A_2)</p>
<p>Go to the console of this article and you will see this in action.</p>
<h2>Math.max and Math.min</h2>
<p>This component can tell you the largest number in a list of number and the other one can yell you the smallest number in a list.</p>
<p>console.log(Math.max(1,2,3,4,6,9)). Same for minimum but you need to use Math.min(_)</p>
<p>Open the console of this website. There you will see the MIN and MAX value of the numbers that i mentioned in the list above.</p>
<h5>CONGRATS! YOU ARE NOW A MASTER CONSOLE VS CODER! GOOD JOB HARRY!</h5>

<script>
console.log("Hello World!")
var A="3.14159265358979"
console.log(A)
var first_name="Albus"
var last_name="Dumbledore"
console.log(first_name.concat(last_name))
var num_1=1
var num_2=1
console.log(num_1 + num_2)
var A_1="Hi"
console.log(typeof A_1)
var A_2=1
console.log(typeof A_2)
console.log(Math.max(1,2,3,4,6,9))
console.log(Math.min(1,2,3,4,6,9))
